Hey this is the Base Template for GD&D Club projects. Just have fun programming :)

You can use any programming language you'd like:
  python file.py (PYTHON)
  gcc file.c (C)
  g++ file.cpp (C++)
  java file.java (Java)
And even more


If a programming language isn't installed go to the terminal and type [ apt get {PACKAGE} ].
This will install any package you'd like. Just search Ubuntu (The computer that is being run) package for ___ programming language.

Thats it bye!
